/*
You have now been asked to include a method that will output a string to the console announcing a level up.
    * Modify the Player class so that it will accept a player name string and a level number in two separate arguments.
    * Then, define a shared object method `info()` that will print the following string, replacing the two placeholders:
      `<name> has reached Level <level>!`
       A player named **Tara** at level **6** should result in "`Tara has reached Level 6!`" printed to the console.
